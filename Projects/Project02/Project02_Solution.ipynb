    ">  All of the following options must meet the following requirements.\n",
    "> 1. All projects must use the \"app class template\" shown below to organize your code.\n",
    "> 2. All projects must automatically save content or history generated during use. A simple text file is sufficient, but other formats are OK too. Each program must automatically load the saved content when the app is started.\n",
    "> 3. Each program must attempt to follow OOP principles, meaning that your attributes and methods are organized into classes. The flow of your program should follow OOP principles of encapsulation and abstraction."

    ">  The AI generated examples included in module 08 are provided as 'prompts' to get you started thinking about your application. None of those examples meet all of the gemeral or specific requirements for the projects listed below. However, they do illustrate one way to solve some programming problems. Study them and then create your own application that meets all the requirements.\n",
    ">  To get started, you may want to sketch out what your app will look like on paper. Then think about the different parts of your sketch in terms of Tkinter widgets. Which parts are labels? entry boxes? buttons? list boxes? text boxes? check boxes? Think about the layout and the best way to place your widgets in the window. For many apps, using a grid layout is easiest, so think about, and maybe even sketch your app in a grid layout. Also think about whether you need frames to help organize the space in the window. Next, think about functionality. What do your buttons do? What happens when you click a checkbox? How and when are calculations done? What variables or attributes will you need? What methods would best handle your app's behavior? Finally, how might you organize your code into classes according to OOP principles? Notice that a lot of this planning happens with pen and paper, not python code. "

    "> 7. As discussed in class, the easiest approach to handling this is to use python's eval() function. eval() evaluates the contents of a string *as if* it was a mathematical expression. This makes a lot of the AI generated code in the example unnecessary. (This is not really a requirement. Just a suggestion.)\n",
    "> 8. Your calculator should have a button to toggle the display of history in your window. (see the lecture images included in module 08). You might think about this in terms of overlapping frames in your window that you can toggle between.\n",
