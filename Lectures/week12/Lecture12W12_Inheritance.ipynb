    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to derive or inherit attributes and methods from another class. This mechanism is designed to promote code reuse, improve maintainability, and establish a relationship between classes, enabling a more organized code structure. In Python, inheritance is achieved by defining a new class (the child or derived class) that extends an existing class (the parent or base class). The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, but it can also define additional attributes and methods or even override existing ones. This makes inheritance a powerful tool for creating hierarchical class structures where more specific classes build upon the functionality of more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit of using inheritance is to avoid duplicating code when classes share similar behaviors. Instead of writing redundant code in each class, a common base class can define the shared functionality, while derived classes can focus on their unique features. For example, in a program involving various types of employees, a <font color=green>BaseEmployee</font> class might contain attributes like <font color=green>name</font> and <font color=green>salary</font>, along with common methods such as <font color=green>calculate_pay()</font>. Derived classes like <font color=green>Manager</font>, <font color=green>Developer</font>, or <font color=green>Intern</font> could inherit from <font color=green>BaseEmployee</font> while adding their own specialized methods or attributes. This structure not only simplifies the code but also makes it more flexible and easier to maintain, as changes in the base class automatically propagate to its derived classes."

    "Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming that occurs when a subclass (or child class) provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass (or parent class). This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class, adapting it to the needs of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, method overriding is achieved by defining a method in the child class with the same name and signature (parameters) as the method in the parent class. When an instance of the child class calls this method, Python will execute the version defined in the child class rather than the one in the parent class. This enables polymorphism, where a single interface can be used with different underlying forms or behaviors depending on the context.\n",
