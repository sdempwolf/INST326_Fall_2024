    "#### Part a: Defining a class, constructing an object, and creating a module\n",
    "This week we finally begin to focus on the core of object-oriented programming: objects.  We use classes to construct or instantiate objects. A class is a kind of data type (like strings, lists, etc.), and an object is an instance of that class or data type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes allow us to group data variables and the functions that use them together. When we do this, our variables are referred to as attributes, and our functions are referred to as methods. This helps a bit with clarity, but is also a way of reminding us that they belong to an object, and are unique to that object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we save our class as a python file, we can call it later as a module in another program. This gives us access to all that functionality without having to write it again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in with some examples.\n",
