    ">>- Facilitates writing generic and reusable code.\n",
    ">>- Simplifies code maintenance by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably.\n",
    ">>- Promotes code extensibility, making it easier to add new functionalities without modifying existing code."

    "#### Duck Typing\n",
    "Python supports polymorphism inherently due to its dynamic typing and duck typing philosophy.\n",
    "> Duck typing is a concept in Python (and other dynamically typed languages) that allows the behavior of an object to determine its suitability for a particular operation, rather than its explicit type. This concept is a core part of Python's design philosophy, where the focus is on what an object can do rather than what an object is.\n",
    ">  The term duck typing comes from the saying:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> In other words, if an object behaves like a certain type (i.e., it has the expected methods and attributes), then it can be treated as that type, regardless of what its actual class is.\n",
    ">  \n",
    ">  **Key Characteristics of Duck Typing:**\n",
    ">>- Focuses on behavior, not inheritance: If an object implements the methods and properties required, it is considered to be of the right type.\n",
    ">>- No need for explicit interfaces: Unlike statically typed languages like Java or C++, Python does not require a class to formally implement an interface.\n",
    ">>- Enables flexible and reusable code by allowing objects of different types to be used interchangeably.\n",
    ">  **How Does Duck Typing Work?**\n",
    "In Python, instead of checking if an object is of a specific type (like checking if an object is an instance of a specific class), you simply use the object and assume it has the methods or attributes you need. If it doesn't, Python will raise an error at runtime.\n",

    "  \n",
    "**Drawbacks of Duck Typing**\n",
    "  \n",
    ">- Lack of type safety: Since type checks are done at runtime, you might encounter errors later in the execution of your program.\n",
    ">- Harder to debug: If an object doesn’t have the required methods, you won’t know until you actually try to use it, which can lead to runtime exceptions.\n",
    ">- Documentation challenges: Duck typing can make it harder for others to understand which types are expected unless properly documented."

    "#### Polymorphism with Operator Overloading\n",
    ">  Operator overloading in Python is a way to extend the behavior of built-in operators (like +, -, *, etc.) so that they can work with user-defined objects (like custom classes). This powerful feature allows you to define how operators should behave when used with your own objects.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">  Operators are symbols like +, -, *, /, and so on, that are used to perform operations on variables or values.  \n",
    ">  Overloading means defining a new behavior for these operators so they can work with objects of a user-defined class.  \n",
    ">  In Python, operators like + or == can be overloaded by defining special methods (also known as dunder methods, short for “double underscore”) in your class.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Why Use Operator Overloading?**  \n",
    ">- Allows for more intuitive and readable code when working with custom objects.\n",
    ">- Makes it possible to perform operations on your objects in a natural, mathematical way, like adding two objects with + instead of calling a method like add().\n",
    "> **How Does Operator Overloading Work?**\n",
    ">  To overload an operator, you need to define a special method in your class. These methods have specific names, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>- __add__() for +\n",
    ">>- __sub__() for -\n",
    ">>- __mul__() for *\n",
    ">>- __truediv__() for /\n",
    ">>- __eq__() for ==\n",
    ">>- __lt__() for <\n",
    ">>- __gt__() for >, and many more.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When you use an operator with objects of your custom class, Python internally calls the corresponding special method.\n",
